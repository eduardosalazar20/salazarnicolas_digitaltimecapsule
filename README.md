In this project we are tasked to show the fundamentals of presenting someone in the form of a website. This includes a home page or landing page of this person giving a description of who they are. This is also company's with the person's likes which include photos and a description of what they like which is their personal interest such as music , games etc. The 3rd section would be what are their activities. This  section has a description and photos describing their activities. Social interactions have also been inlcuded such as links that take you to other websites and embeded music. 

# technical overview:

The software that was used for this website was visual studio code. Using HTML and CSS the website was able to be created and designed in a unique manner to achieve a certain theme. As part of this process the theme of this website is a music theme website. Code was used to create all these selections, such as h1-h6 tags, p , ul, nav and li tags. This targeted specific aspects of the websites which included color, fonts, spacing, navigations, adjusting images and adding gifs and interactions. 

To target the images, img was included in order to embed pictures of Eduardo Salazar for the home page. Music playlists and music images for the likes page. As for the activities page Images of the clothing brand Ralph lauren. Images that have a link attached to a tag in order to go to the official website of Ralph Lauren. For the navigation bar the nav tag was used to create the navigation bar which included a white background and an inline format in order to get the navbars on the same line. 

Fonts that were used of this technical process were Nunito San Serif and Oribtrion San Serif, rel was used to add the font onto the website. These fonts achieved the the music asthetic theme. This gave us a nice structure capturing a unique page that has striking appeal to the page.
